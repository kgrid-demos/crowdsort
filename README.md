# CrowdSort 

CrowdSort is a web app concept in prototype format.

This concept involves 3 things:
  * Comparison sorting (from computer science)
  * Experts answering "this or that" questions (somewhat like either.io)
  * Having a crowd develop a risk model by sorting things by relative risk

Although CrowdSorting could be applied to many things, the first use case is in regards to medication risk. 

Imagine if experienced pharmacists could routinely use a system to compare two drugs head-to-head and tell the system which of the two drugs carried the greater risk. If this is possible, then, using a "crowd" of pharmacists, it may be possible to develop and test the reliability and validity of a relative risk measurement for medications. 

This idea is the starting point for CrowdSort, and the basis of a feasability experiment taking place during the Winter of 2019 (formal research paper to follow).

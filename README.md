# CrowdSort 

CrowdSort is a web app concept in prototype format.

This concept involves 3 things:
  • Comparison sorting (from computer science)
  • Experts answering "this or that" questions (somewhat like either.io)
  • Having a crowd develop a risk model by sorting things by relative risk

Although CrowdSorting could be applied to many things, the first use case is a medication use case.

Imagine if experienced pharmacists could routinely use a system to compare two drugs head-to-head and tell the system which of the two drugs carried the greater risk. If this is possible, then, using a "crowd" of pharmacists, it may be possible to develop and test the reliability and validity of a relative risk measurement for medications. 

This idea is the starting point for CrowdSort.
